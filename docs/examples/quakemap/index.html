    <h5><a href="../../index.html" class="">Seisplotjs</a> - <a href="../index.html" class="">Examples</a> - QuakeMap</h5>

    <p>Seisplotjs contains a simple map element and class that allow easily
      plotting station as triangles and earthquakes as circles on a leaflet
      map. The aim of this is to make it simple and easy to create a basic
      map, but not to provide for creating more complex maps. For that case
      it is better to create a map via normal leaflet code and then just
      use seisplotjs to create the markers for the stations and earthquakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, we plot stations for the II and IU networks, significant
      earthquakes from the last month from the USGS and tectonic regions, also
      from the USGS. Each station, event or region can be clicked on to
      show more information. This illustrates the use of quakeclick and
      stationclick custom events, which make it easier to deal with actions
      like this.
